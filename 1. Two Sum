#Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

#You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

#You can return the answer in any order.





class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        values = {} #opening an empty matrix 
        for idx, value in enumerate(nums): #for IDX which is for the index, "value" in **enumerate, which adds counter to an iterable and returns it
            if target - value in values: #first if target int minus values enumerated from nums is yes, 
                return [values[target - value], idx] #return the values into the matrix that reverse of sum in q (target-value) in idx
            else:
                values[value] = idx #otherwise its find left in index
