#Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s):        #defining function self, s
        if not s:                   
            return 0                #for no match
        dic = {"I":1, "V":5, "X":10, "L":50, "C":100, "D":500, "M":1000}  #create dictionary
        n = len(s)        #new variable n stands for the amount of numbers in input s
        total = dic[s[n-1]] #length minus one list inside of input list that is inside of dict.  
        for i in range(n-1,0,-1): #start loop to go through the input in order from L to R 
            current = dic[s[i]] #"current" is L to R the first it sees matching dict. sum the same numbers eg III =3
            prev = dic[s[i-1]] #when a number is smaller than the previous one, add them e.g. VI = 6 
            total += prev if prev >= current else -prev #doing what above 2 lines said where the above 2 just set variables 
        return total
